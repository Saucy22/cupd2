# cupd2
Cupd2 (Codename: Helmet) is the second version of Calebs Updater for linux. Now written in go (as opposed to python)

# What?
Calebs Updater 2 is a program that simplifies the update process for linux machines by making 2-4 commands into 1

# Why?
If you're lazy like me and dont like to type in multiple commands for one task, this app is for you. You can also use this script as a universial updater for multiple linux distros if you often forget package manager syntax.

# How? (to install)
Follow the instructions included with your release version

# Features
This program can currently update:

Ubuntu/Debian based systems (apt)
Fedora based systems (DNF5 only)
OpenSUSE systems (zypper)
